1. Write a python program using functions to take input from the user and calculate the 
factorial of the number.
Ans.
def factorial(n):
    if n==0 or n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
try:
    num=int(input("enter a number to find its factorial: - "))
    if num<0:
        print("please write a non negative number ")
    else:
        result=factorial(num)
        print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("invalid input.please enter a integer not a character")

3. Write a program to calculate the nth term of Fibonacci series.
Ans.
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return "Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer."

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]

    while len(fib_sequence) <= n:
        next_term = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
        fib_sequence.append(next_term)

 
return fib_sequence[n]





4. Write a random number generator that generates random numbers between 1 and 6.
Ans.
import random
def random_no():
     return print(random.randint(1,6))
while True:
     random_no()
     break

calculate the product and power of the ϐirst 10 numbers.
Ans.
 def pap(*n):
     product = 1
     power = 1
     for i in range(1,11):
            product = i*i
            power = i**i
            return print(product) , print(power)
 pap()





6. Write a program to accept the number of days and display appropriate weeks in an 
integer. Display an appropriate error message if input is not an integer. Handle the 
errors including the ϐinally clause.
Ans.
def days_to_weeks(days):
    try:
        days = int(days)
        weeks = days // 7
        print(f"{days} days is approximately {weeks} weeks.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Input is not an integer.")
    finally:
        print("Program executed.")

days = input("Enter the number of days: ")

days_to_weeks(days)
